    <strong>One of a kind construction.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Kitchen, bath need new life? Living space not working for you? We do space reconfigurations for any area of the house including attics and basements. Or we can fashion an entire new home design start to finish. We also make custom hardware, furniture, sinks and faucets. Just about anything that goes into your home can be created as a personalized, one of a kind experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our design process brings out the unique features of each project, tailored to your needs and budget.

    Browse our photo galleries to see examples of our work: a 9th century chapel for housing antique radios, or a home built in place of one lost in the 1989 fire using timbers recycled from the old Proctor &amp; Gamble soap factory and carved with ancient symbols to ward off the fire spirits.

  <p>
    We build everything in concert with you the homeowner supported by a network of local artisans and craftspeople we've worked with over the years
  </p>

    Let's begin a conversation about your project and how it can be creatively designed to truly reflect your personality and taste.
